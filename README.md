# Amplifier Simple Context Manager Module

Basic message list context manager for conversation state.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - Fast Python package manager

### Installing UV

```bash
# macOS/Linux/WSL
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Purpose

Provides straightforward in-memory conversation context management. This is the reference implementation and default context manager.

## Contract

**Module Type:** Context
**Mount Point:** `contexts`
**Entry Point:** `amplifier_module_context_simple:mount`

## Behavior

- In-memory message list
- No persistence across sessions
- Automatic compaction when approaching token limit (keeps system messages + last 10 messages)
- **Preserves tool pairs as atomic units** during compaction (data integrity guarantee)

## Configuration

```toml
[[contexts]]
module = "context-simple"
name = "simple"
config = {
    max_messages = 100  # Optional limit
}
```

## Usage

```python
# In amplifier configuration
[session]
context = "context-simple"
```

Perfect for:

- Development and testing
- Short conversations
- Stateless applications

Not suitable for:

- Cross-session persistence
- Custom compaction strategies

## Compaction Strategy

The SimpleContextManager compacts automatically when token usage reaches the configured threshold (default: 92% of max_tokens):

- **Keeps**: All system messages + last 10 conversation messages
- **Deduplicates**: Non-tool messages (based on role and first 100 chars of content)
- **Preserves tool pairs**: Tool_use and tool_result messages are treated as atomic units
  - If keeping assistant message with tool_calls, keeps next tool message
  - If keeping tool message, keeps previous assistant message
  - Never deduplicates tool-related messages (each has unique ID)

### Tool Pair Preservation

Anthropic API requires that every tool_use in message N has a matching tool_result in message N+1. The context manager preserves these pairs as atomic units during compaction to maintain conversation state integrity and prevent API errors.

**Critical implementation detail**: When an assistant message has multiple tool_calls, there are multiple consecutive tool_result messages after it. The compaction logic walks backwards through these tool results to find the originating assistant message, ensuring the entire tool group is preserved as an atomic unit. This prevents orphaned tool results that would cause API validation errors.

## Dependencies

- `amplifier-core>=1.0.0`
